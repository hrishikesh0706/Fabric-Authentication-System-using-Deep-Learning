# Fabric-Authentication-System-using-Deep-Learning
The aim of this project is to distinguish between hand-made and machine-made fabric by classifying images based on various parameters. These parameters include texture and patterns, thread consistency, edges, seamlines, and the complexity of weave using Deep Learning.
